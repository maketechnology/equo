  Forget about recreating your existing Java application to get a modern web-like one running in the Desktop. Forget about recoding your Java backends with Javascript. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Equo not only provides the ability to create modern desktop applications from scrach, but it also allows you to migrate your old style application easily. It takes care of your code base, so you can reuse it and focus on the thing that matters, the UI.

  It doesn't matter whether your app is web based or desktop based (i.e. an Eclipse RCP application), a migration is straightforward with Equo.
